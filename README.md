# Lessons that utilize two heart disease datasets - economic and hospital data.

# lessons

These lessons employ over a dozen models to build ensemble models for the UCI heart disease dataset.

Special focus is on developing a framework for finding the right train-test split and correcting bias when training over a dozen models.

Using an ensemble model, we are able to obtain 86% accuracy on heart disease prediction given hospital data (from 30 years ago).

# heart_disease_indicators

We explore heart disease from an economic perspective where we employ ensemble methods to get a weighted accuracy of 78% of predicting heart disease from economic and self-identifying poll data alone.

# custom_functions

Plotting, feature selection and cross correlation custom functions, especially for feature selection and model comparison.
